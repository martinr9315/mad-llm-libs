# MadLLMLibs

This is a unique and interactive application that leverages the power of OpenAI's language models to create a fun and engaging MadLibs game. Play [here](https://mad-llm-libs.vercel.app)!

The application is a hybrid of Next.js and Python, using Next.js for the frontend and Flask for the API backend. The game uses OpenAI's API to generate creative and unexpected templates for the MadLibs, providing a new and exciting experience every time you play.

## Models 

This application is built on top of OpenAI's Davinci model. At the time of development, the 3.5-turbo model was experiencing timeout issues, hence the decision to use the Davinci model. This application serves as a great example of how AI can be integrated into web applications to enhance functionality and user experience.

## How It Works

The Python/Flask server is mapped into to Next.js app under `/api/`.

This is implemented using [`next.config.js` rewrites](https://github.com/vercel/examples/blob/main/python/nextjs-flask/next.config.js) to map any request to `/api/:path*` to the Flask API, which is hosted in the `/api` folder.

On localhost, the rewrite will be made to the `127.0.0.1:5328` port, which is where the Flask server is running.

In production, the Flask server is hosted as [Python serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python) on Vercel.

## Developing Locally

You can clone & create this repo with the following command

```bash
npx create-next-app nextjs-flask --example "https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/python/nextjs-flask"
```

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The Flask server will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:5328](http://127.0.0.1:5328) – feel free to change the port in `package.json` (you'll also need to update it in `next.config.js`).

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
