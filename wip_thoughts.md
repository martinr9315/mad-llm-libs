WIP Thoughts
- make sure to set up venv (command is python3 -m venv env)
    - check location of Python interpreter, if in env directory, venv is working
- follow this: https://www.cronj.com/blog/full-stack-web-application-with-react-nextjs-and-python/
  to set up Python backend with Next.js frontend
- use APE (https://github.com/keirp/automatic_prompt_engineer) to design prompt for generating goofy MadLibs
- simple user input or all LLM generated ? being able to toggle between options would be cool
    - for LLM generated: input/output pairing is ex: animal->cat, color->turquoise, famous place->the Vatican

Potential future derivations:
Story-finisher
Chapter-generator (input framework, writing style)
    Character-extractor? - for continuity 
Little kid educational book writer (input concept, idea for story/maybe characters)
