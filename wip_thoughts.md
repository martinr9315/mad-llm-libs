WIP Thoughts
- use APE (https://github.com/keirp/automatic_prompt_engineer) to design prompt 
- simple user input or all LLM generated ? being able to toggle between options would be cool
    - for LLM generated: input/output pairing is ex: animal->cat, color->turquoise, famous place->the Vatican

Potential future derivations:
Story-finisher
Chapter-generator (input framework, writing style)
    Character-extractor? - for continuity 
Little kid educational book writer (input concept, idea for story/maybe characters, integration with DALL-E!)
